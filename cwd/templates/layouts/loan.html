<h2>Fixed Rate Loan</h2>
<p>Under a fixed rate loan, the interest rate is fixed for a specified period, usually between one and five years. This loan gives you the certainty of knowing exactly what your monthly repayments will be and peace of mind knowing the repayments won’t rise. However you won’t benefit if rates go down during the fixed term.</p>

<strong>Advantages:</strong>

<p>Guaranteed rate, if interest rates rise your repayments won’t.</p>
<strong>Disadvantages:</strong>

Reduced flexibility.
<p>Extra repayments may incur a fee or be limited.</p>

<h2>100% Offset Loan Account</h2>
<p>A 100% offset loan is very similar to an all-in-one loan. Rather than putting all your salary and other income into your loan, it goes into an offset account that is directly linked to your home loan. Any balance in the offset account is 100% ‘offset’ against your home loan. This reduces the amount of interest you have to repay, making your money work harder for you.</p>

<strong>Advantages:</strong>

<p>Can save you substantial amount of interest if used correctly.
Operates like a normal transaction account and has a chequebook, ATM card, etc. attached.</p>
Disadvantages:

<p>May have higher monthly fees attached to the account.
May require a minimum balance in the account</p>

<h2>Line of Credit Loan</h2>
<p>A line of credit loan provides you with access to the equity in your home or investment properties up to a pre-approved limit. You access the funds as you need to. The interest rate on a line of credit loan is usually a variable rate and repayments are interest only.
</p>
Advantages:

<p>You can use the money when you need it and pay it back when you can.
Rates are generally lower than a personal loan or credit card.</p>
Disadvantages:

<p>Unless care is shown it is possible to reduce the equity you have built in your home.</p>

<h2>Construction Loans</h2>
<p>If you are building your own home or investment property, a construction loan may be suitable for you. This loan requires a fixed price building contract from a registered builder. These loans are usually interest only for the period of building and then become principal and interest once building is completed. A construction loan allows you to draw money as is required whilst building. Also, with the usual necessary documents required when applying for a loan, construction loans also require a ‘fixed price building contract’ and ‘council approved plans’.</p>
<strong>Advantages:</strong>

<p>Competitive variable interest rates.
Facility to draw money when necessary whilst building.
Interest only payments during the building period.
Additional payments can be made.</p>
<strong>Disadvantages:</strong>

<p>Requires a fixed price building contract leaving little room for change whilst building.</p>
<p>Some lenders charge a fee for every time you draw money whilst building.
Given it is a variable loan; loan repayments will increase if interest rates go up.</p>

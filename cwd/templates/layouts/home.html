Maxwell Financial Services Pty Ltd was formed on 1 July 2004 after Managing Director Russell Maxwell identified an opportunity in the market to provide the full suite of commercial and residential finance products from one single contact point. Dealing with one bank or lending institution only allows the prospective borrower access to a limited range of products. By dealing with a professional finance broker, the client is provided with a full range of products from many different lenders, ensuring the client has access to the best products for their needs and the most competitive pricing.

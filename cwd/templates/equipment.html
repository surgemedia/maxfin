<h2>Equipment &amp; Vehicle finance</h2>

<p>There are many funding options available to clients seeking to purchase equipment or motor vehicles. We specialise in the finance of equipment and motor vehicles used primarily for business purposes.</p>

<p>Finance options include:</p>

<ul>

<li>	Finance Lease</li>
<li>	Operating Lease or Rental</li>
<li>	Novated Lease/Salary packaging</li>
</ul>
 	 
<p>There are many factors to consider when financing equipment or motor vehicles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal structure. Term and residual value best suited for an affordable facility but ensuring an acceptable exit strategy at the end of the term or in the event of early termination. In the case of Leasing, ATO guidelines are in place for the setting of residual values. Other issues include matching payments with income cycles by way of accelerated rentals, annual rentals, seasonal payments etc.</li>
<li>Tax implications. You should seek advice from your accountant as the different facilities have varying impact on GST and tax deductibility of interest, depreciation or rentals. Maxwell Financial have Commercial accreditations with the majority of commercial lenders which provides access to all commercial products including business acquisition and refinance, commercial property finance, equipment and motor vehicle finance and debtor funding.</li>
<li>Interest rates, fees and charges. All financiers will have different application fees, early termination fees, interest rates etc. At any given time a lender may be offering special rates for certain products.
